Using node.js and MySQL, the objective is to create an Amazon-esque storefront that accepts and caters to user-responses. 
The app will offer a list of products available for purchase, and once the user selects the id of the item they are interested
in purchasing, the app will loop through its list of stock to see if it can fulfill the order/request. If not, the user will 
get a message telling them there is not enough of that item in stock.
